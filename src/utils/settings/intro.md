## Overview

This demo include pure headless and headful content delivered from Experience Fragments.  There are 3 possible setups for this demo.

1. You can use the demo as is from <a href='https://aem-pure-headless.vercel.app/'>this link</a>.  This will be a fully headless site using GraphQL and Experience Fragments from AEM.  You can use the the View GQL button to share the Request and Response from AEM.

2. If you want to customize the content, use the experience template called Headless First inside of the Reference Demo to create a new site.  Then return here and insert the URL and project (folder name) to connect your Cloud Service instance to this demo.

3. If you want to fully customize the demo, you clone the <a href='https://github.com/lamontacrook/aem-pure-headless'>project</a> and build it locally.  This site does not use an .env file for configuration properties.  Instead it uses this setting page for configuration.  Forthcoming video on how to navigate then project.
